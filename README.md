# Synthesis of Ecology Marine Water Monitoring Data #
#### Nearshore Habitat Program ####
#### Washington State Department of Natural Resources ####

The goal of this project is to read and integrate data from netCDF files distributed by the Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology) from their Marine Water Monitoring Program.

The source netCDF files are available from Ecology at: https://ecology.wa.gov/Research-Data/Monitoring-assessment/Puget-Sound-and-marine-monitoring/Water-column-data

The output from the code in this repository were used to create a web app for browsing the Ecology dataset:  https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/94aa60295f53496fbd6327c829d18d8a
